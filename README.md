## 🧸💬 Directory from Javascript project and docker online deployment

👧💬 🎈 Browsing catalog from a deployed web application and there are 3 parts ```front-end interface```, ```backend interface```, and ```database```. Populate items in specific search items parameters into the grid and display them as card items on the front-end interfaces container ```drilled down of each item interaction``` for its detail display and can be updated. </br>
🦭💬 ```JavaScript language``` is Java language development for web applications, it is ```specific to methods```, ```controls```, ```integration methods```, and ```security```. Do not judge by name it creates tiny and specific for safe of method interactions. </br>
🦭💬 These requirements depend on customer and system design examples ```SpringBoot framework``` is one of Java and programming development platforms, ```Django``` is a multi-language programming platform, ```Java EE``` for client development, ```DotNet frameworks``` for Microsoft specific purpose development platform, ```C++ distribution``` is compliers and requires C++ components, ```Python Learning environment``` is Python-specific simulation learning and GUI platform, ```Simulink MATLAB``` is system simulation platform and many of development platform they build we can work with our requirements. </br>
🦁💬 ```Communication exchange``` of items search criteria, target method, namespace or control parameters, and priority. Network tracking without tools or reference can guess a number of specific parameters and methods from replay messages and compare when the exchange messages have not been encrypted to a standard format. ```Encrypted message``` exchanges still have a number of bytes transmitting and expecting value as ```TCP/IP format``` where they do not apply application to this role they can specific message communication as encryption message. This flag helps with ```communication load``` and ```reduces calculation process time for hash items calculation```, the same communication signals need to select acceptable speed, protocol, actions, standards, and terminal syntax. Some engineers discover of ```double tips on sending commands from the terminal``` or ```continuing input commands support``` and ```delay response without correcting these settings``` . </br>
🐐💬 Soros I think ```double tips``` that is because of ```negotiation speed for communication```, distance, and priority they need to tell you about display ```response expectations``` you just update negotiation speeds as in some router command but today people forget it. </br>
🐐💬 In ```symmetric encryption``` used in ```fast communications``` we do not expect decrypt input parameters we only expect a number of parameter inputs and their priority, steady updates, or changes in command and expectations. Encryption is a good method for communication but if it leaks you cannot know who had the message read. Development uses ```real-time input parameters``` or ```unique values``` or ```negotiation time password communications```, there is a technique of repeaters try to decrypt of communication message in the open area by sending it to the ```target repeater``` and ```next to``` until they try to complete of the communication and return some message this is call ```broadcasting bombard``` . </br>
🐑💬 ➰ Development of the communication system and its interfaces need to be performed on security methods and they need to ```evaluate users and area usage```, it is difficult to ```control information``` or some ```system expectation``` leaks because of input parameters are information and ```indicators``` when using table value exchange possible when ```negotiation message``` happen. </br>

## 🧸💬 Registration

🐑💬 ➰ Registration method, multiple standards need to be followed but it is programming that can be created for customer requirements. The standard method is using ```GET HTTP request``` with ```clientID``` and some ```unique parameters``` for requests for ```sessionID``` and ```hash item``` / ```hash key``` . </br>
🐐💬 There are visible attributes and client attributes where they are exchanged and communication in the background some of attributes such as ```AgentID```, ```ClientID```, ```ClientType``` and some communication protocols they allow you to embed the ```applicationID```, ```registrationID```, ```extensions```, ```channelID``` and ```HostID```. The HostID in communication is specific because of it is not a ```hostname``` but it means a ```unique HostID``` value generated by a specific method for the ```correct installation software``` and ```communication channels communication to be created``` . </br>
🦤💬 There are multiple methods for creating HostID and ClientID, in secured communication it is a specific HostID but it can use a parameter name and there are ClientIDs from web client communication. Some communication devices does not include channelID because they can have multiple channels and it is a ```duplicated value``` but when applied to application communication some of them use channelID which is called ```identify by the method of use```. </br>
💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 ```Communication by authentication``` is authorized selected when authentication with ```multiple levels of user accessibility``` and permissions can have a different number of communication methods as programming design for ```primary communication``` method as one input parameter for authentication, extension number, and channelID. </br>
```👤💬 I found someone's written requirements have HostID and interactionID ⁉️ ```  👤💬 TOR 👤💬 TOR 👤💬 TOR ngui huurrr ‼️ </br>

## 🧸💬 Login

🐑💬 ➰ Login methods with the same clientID or different expected clientID depend on the method of use because of application need ```hash item number``` of a ```unique number``` for input as one of the authentication parameters, login API works on this in the ```background processes``` by ```communicationID```, ```UUID```, ```database login time``` and etc. In some attention logins, they had different clientID but the use of passwords was generated during the negotiation process by manual call ```onetime password``` . </br>
🦭💬 There are multiple authentication libraries used for authentication with different standards can settings such as ```jwt``` as in this project, we use both ```wildcards standards``` and web secure communication encryption and ```stage communication technology``` for communication to save the number of requests and security. </br>
🐐💬 Before and After login should be notifications or significant see of ```display result and identification``` because of in simple method of screen capture can authentication identity as a different account or mistake performed actions on an unlocked account create some ```information leaks```. This method is simple but has a lot of effects on the ```Internet Cafe era``` until the government challenges new hackers from students by opening secured Internet Cafe shops and many of policy. ```🐱💬 Not to be sad students need to grow in a good way and support``` . </br>

🐨🎁🎵🎶 One technique calls ```re-direct message``` because of login success requirement only informs information to the client or target client for correct login action and ```response with uniqueID```, some appliation are trapped by rerouting of the message by the ```virtual router and intercepted``` with appliation for re-used of the uniqueID for their ```simulation actions application``` . </br>
