## 🧸💬 Directory from Javascript project and docker online deployment

👧💬 🎈 Browsing catalog from a deployed web application and there are 3 parts ```front-end interface```, ```backend interface```, and ```database```. Populate items in specific search items parameters into the grid and display them as card items on the front-end interfaces container ```drilled down of each item interaction``` for its detail display and can be updated. </br>
🦭💬 ```JavaScript language``` is Java language development for web applications, it is ```specific to methods```, ```controls```, ```integration methods```, and ```security```. Do not judge by name it creates tiny and specific for safe of method interactions. </br>
🦭💬 These requirements depend on customer and system design examples ```SpringBoot framework``` is one of Java and programming development platforms, ```Django``` is a multi-language programming platform, ```Java EE``` for client development, ```DotNet frameworks``` for Microsoft specific purpose development platform, ```C++ distribution``` is compliers and requires C++ components, ```Python Learning environment``` is Python-specific simulation learning and GUI platform, ```Simulink MATLAB``` is system simulation platform and many of development platform they build we can work with our requirements. </br>
🦁💬 ```Communication exchange``` of items search criteria, target method, namespace or control parameters, and priority. Network tracking without tools or reference can guess a number of specific parameters and methods from replay messages and compare when the exchange messages have not been encrypted to a standard format. ```Encrypted message``` exchanges still have a number of bytes transmitting and expecting value as ```TCP/IP format``` where they do not apply application to this role they can specific message communication as encryption message. This flag helps with ```communication load``` and ```reduces calculation process time for hash items calculation```, the same communication signals need to select acceptable speed, protocol, actions, standards, and terminal syntax. Some engineers discover of ```double tips on sending commands from the terminal``` or ```continuing input commands support``` and ```delay response without correcting these settings``` . </br>
🐐💬 Soros I think ```double tips``` that is because of ```negotiation speed for communication```, distance, and priority they need to tell you about display ```response expectations``` you just update negotiation speeds as in some router command but today people forget it. </br>
🐐💬 In ```symmetric encryption``` used in ```fast communications``` we do not expect decrypt input parameters we only expect a number of parameter inputs and their priority, steady updates, or changes in command and expectations. Encryption is a good method for communication but if it leaks you cannot know who had the message read. Development uses ```real-time input parameters``` or ```unique values``` or ```negotiation time password communications```, there is a technique of repeaters try to decrypt of communication message in the open area by sending it to the ```target repeater``` and ```next to``` until they try to complete of the communication and return some message this is call ```broadcasting bombard``` . </br>
🐑💬 ➰ Development of the communication system and its interfaces need to be performed on security methods and they need to ```evaluate users and area usage```, it is difficult to ```control information``` or some ```system expectation``` leaks because of input parameters are information and ```indicators``` when using table value exchange possible when ```negotiation message``` happen. </br>

## 🧸💬 Registration

🐑💬 ➰ Registration method, multiple standards need to be followed but it is programming that can be created for customer requirements. The standard method is using ```GET HTTP request``` with ```clientID``` and some ```unique parameters``` for requests for ```sessionID``` and ```hash item``` / ```hash key``` . </br>
🐐💬 There are visible attributes and client attributes where they are exchanged and communication in the background some of attributes such as ```AgentID```, ```ClientID```, ```ClientType``` and some communication protocols they allow you to embed the ```applicationID```, ```registrationID```, ```extensions```, ```channelID``` and ```HostID```. The HostID in communication is specific because of it is not a ```hostname``` but it means a ```unique HostID``` value generated by a specific method for the ```correct installation software``` and ```communication channels communication to be created``` . </br>
🦤💬 There are multiple methods for creating HostID and ClientID, in secured communication it is a specific HostID but it can use a parameter name and there are ClientIDs from web client communication. Some communication devices does not include channelID because they can have multiple channels and it is a ```duplicated value``` but when applied to application communication some of them use channelID which is called ```identify by the method of use```. </br>
💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 ```Communication by authentication``` is authorized selected when authentication with ```multiple levels of user accessibility``` and permissions can have a different number of communication methods as programming design for ```primary communication``` method as one input parameter for authentication, extension number, and channelID. </br>
```👤💬 I found someone's written requirements have HostID and interactionID ⁉️ ```  👤💬 TOR 👤💬 TOR 👤💬 TOR ngui huurrr ‼️ ( They play funny conversation, background is requirements from developing system high priority ) </br>

## 🧸💬 Login

🐑💬 ➰ Login methods with the same clientID or different expected clientID depend on the method of use because of application need ```hash item number``` of a ```unique number``` for input as one of the authentication parameters, login API works on this in the ```background processes``` by ```communicationID```, ```UUID```, ```database login time``` and etc. In some attention logins, they had different clientID but the use of passwords was generated during the negotiation process by manual call ```onetime password``` . </br>
🦭💬 There are multiple authentication libraries used for authentication with different standards can settings such as ```jwt``` as in this project, we use both ```wildcards standards``` and web secure communication encryption and ```stage communication technology``` for communication to save the number of requests and security. </br>
🐐💬 Before and After login should be notifications or significant see of ```display result and identification``` because of in simple method of screen capture can authentication identity as a different account or mistake performed actions on an unlocked account create some ```information leaks```. This method is simple but has a lot of effects on the ```Internet Cafe era``` until the government challenges new hackers from students by opening secured Internet Cafe shops and many of policy. ```🐱💬 Not to be sad students need to grow in a good way and support``` . </br>

🐨🎁🎵🎶 One technique calls ```re-direct message``` because of login success requirement only informs information to the client or target client for correct login action and ```response with uniqueID```, some appliation are trapped by rerouting of the message by the ```virtual router and intercepted``` with appliation for re-used of the uniqueID for their ```simulation actions application``` . </br>

## 🧸💬 Database

👧💬 🎈 In an application that needs to ```start with a simple method``` of database design you can use MongoDB, the ```migration process can be performed``` to a relational database or using both systems for spatial domain items, objects information, and tabular records. </br>
🐑💬 ➰ There is MongoDB and ```Python library``` but working with some development platforms you need to create or update some codes for datatable adaptors, read, write, update, find, and ```required methods``` for working with some specific database and the same as you build a custom ```dataset``` in TensorFlow. In this way, you can use a ```secured communication``` method for Oracle 21c., working with ```.json query``` and ```file``` as d```atabase object``` . ```🦭💬 Also image in .json``` [Sample object in .json in TensorFlow](https://github.com/jkaewprateep/json_data_set?tab=readme-ov-file#result) </br>

## 🧸💬 Pagination

👧💬 🎈 ```Pagination is the accessibility of items``` and their property as inserted, updated, and unique. Using a rational database you need to create a ```store procedure```, or ```prepare statement``` or ```program``` to work with complex query records if you design on ```singular table with a control ID for each item in database rows```. No-SQL database can work on this issue with ```fast development time``` . </br>
🐐💬 There are many techniques for ```replay message communication```, one is to ```interrupt the message``` when the user or application performs action when ```navigation panes``` and ```pagination``` are not verified by many applications and ```not standard controls``` where they can add them as insertion codes that allow some hackers to add them for specific action without warning or notify. </br>
🦭💬 There is one ```Another meaning of pagination``` is when the request-response is a resultset with ```page number``` and ```navigation per page``` this kind of resultset has ```benefits in communication such as REST API services```, websites, and co-responding systems such as printer scanners, and storage vending machines because of delay message response behavior for validation if required. </br>
🐐💬 Error handling of the pagination interrupted this kind of communication by changing the number of ```unique values in communications``` or ```number of items per page```. By comparison of two result set or targets, the process should restart or error. </br>

## 🧸💬 Integrated parameters

🐨🎁🎵🎶 Code engine allowed to instant deployment of a web application for ```secured code running environments```, see the update message response can control and ```network route to priority database```. There is multiple access prevention they can perform ```tracking by attaching some unique values or remark methods```. Update of ```aware IP address to server communication list``` for tracking with different level and ```web application versions```, safe actions are performed on specific versions of web application and secured web can submit multiple versions of web applications but webmasters think that is time spending for this method response they select to use ```networks response``` that is easier but ```simple analyze methods```. There are more response policies and this is beyond the tools we are using because they are police ```💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 We are working we have money to fight with hackers do prohibited actions for money to win in this wars``` . </br>

## 🧸💬 Deployment

🧸💬 Simple question is someone asking me how ```GitHub provides virtual environments services```, here it is but you need to do it the correct way to deploy with deployment scripts. GitHub provides many services and this method they are working as docker same as Kubenentes, Anaconda, CodeEngine, VMware, and etc. </br>
🐐💬 ```Development process including selection of library and working environments```, there are multiple versions of appliation that can have multiple versions of running environments and they need some maintenance. ```Some mistakes and leaks of information to untrusted people can lead the way for hackers```, they can post some library required for application, make them easy, or just simplify a method. Once the programmer deploys the codes and creates deployment scripts this library or program needs to be maintenance because after running they are not monitored inside of the cabinet. </br>
